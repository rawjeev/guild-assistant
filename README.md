**Guild Assistant** is a Conversational AI tool that helps design ecologically sound and site-specific life guilds.

---

## Project Description

A tool that helps design native plant guilds for ecological restoration, agroforestry, and permaculture. It combines **LLMs**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **Semantic Web Knowledge Graphs**, and **ML-based recommendations** â€” built with modern AI engineering patterns to reason about combinations of flora and fauna for specific ecoregions, climates, and goals.

## Motivation

**Ecological guilds** â€” combinations of flora and fauna that support each other â€” are core to agro-ecosystems of many tribal peoples and indigenous communities all over the world, and more recently to permaculture design, agro-ecology and ecological conservation. With over **382,000 species of plants** and **867 terrestrial ecoregions worldwide**, selecting species that work well together, *adapted to specific climates, soils, and human needs* requires integrating vast and diverse knowledge. An assistive tool to help the process is very beneficial. 

## Project Goals

Guild Assistant aims to be a **conversational design companion** that helps permaculture designers and conservationists:
- Explore species options for their location
- Understand ecological interactions
- Generate guilds adapted to local context and human needs
- Learn as they interact with the system

## Learning and Capstone Goals

This is also a **Capstone project** with these goals:
- Build a *working MVP* that shows value to users
- Learn and apply **LLM orchestration patterns** (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI)
- Combine **RAG** with **structured Semantic Web knowledge** (RDF/SPARQL)
- Implement **ML-based recommendation** from ecological data
- Demonstrate **explainable AI** â€” traceable suggestions grounded in data
- Contribute a novel and useful tool to the **AI for Ecology / Permaculture** community
